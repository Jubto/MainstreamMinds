A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for transactional reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.  Thank you for understanding what I'm doing here, and even if you decide not to kick in at https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday , I'm super grateful you took the time to watch this video!

These soft robots have many advantages over traditional robots \u2014 they're safer, lighter, more flexible and can change their shape and size.NASA is investigating the use of soft robots for space missions. For future visits to Enceladus or Europa, a lander could cut a hole in the ice and then insert a compliant robot through the hole.

        "description": "NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance mission captured thrilling footage of its rover landing in Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.  The real footage in this video was captured by several cameras that are part of the rover's entry, descent, and landing suite. The views include a camera looking down from the spacecraft's descent stage (a kind of rocket-powered jet pack that helps fly the rover to its landing site), a camera on the rover looking up at the descent stage, a camera on the top of the aeroshell (a capsule protecting the rover) looking up at that parachute, and a camera on the bottom of the rover looking down at the Martian surface. The audio embedded in the video comes from the mission control call-outs during entry, descent, and landing.

Much of the script-writing was inspired and informed by his wonderful book Sync, and his 2004 TED talk. He is a giant in this field, and has literally written the book on chaos, complexity, and synchronization. It was hard to find a paper in this field that Steven (or one of his students) didn't contribute to.

        "description": "NASA\u2019s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter takes off and lands in this video captured on April 25, 2021, by Mastcam-Z, an imager aboard NASA\u2019s Perseverance Mars rover. As expected, the helicopter flew out of its field of vision while completing a flight plan that took it 164 feet (50 meters) downrange of the landing spot. Keep watching, the helicopter will return to stick the landing. Top speed for today's flight was about 2 meters per second, or about 4.5 miles-per-hour.The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was built by JPL, which also manages this technology demonstration project for NASA Headquarters. It is supported by NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, and Space Technology Mission Directorate. NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center provided significant flight performance analysis and technical assistance during Ingenuity\u2019s development.A key objective for Perseverance\u2019s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet\u2019s geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust). Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA\u2019s Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover.For more about Perseverance:-mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/-nasa.gov/perseveranceCredit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS"

Most metals are hard, but sodium metal is really soft, and you can squish it, just with your fingers, if you squeeze really hard. Metals are usually shiny, and sodium metal is as well, but because it's so reactive, it quickly tarnishes. But because it's so soft, it can be easily cut with a knife, and on the inside, we can see the nice and shiny metal.-------------------------------------------Nile talks about lab safety:  https://youtu.be/ftACSEJ6DZA\u200b#shorts"

        "description": "This is not just true of slinkies - if you release a steel rod from the top, the top really starts falling before the bottom. If you hit a tennis ball with a racket, a wave has to travel from the strings to your hand before you feel it - and the ball is well on its way to the net by this time. If you hit a golf ball, the ball is well on its way to the hole before you can feel it. Rigid bodies aren't truly rigid and understanding this is essential to understanding the way the world works"

And also, the first 200 people will get 20% off their annual premium membership. Hydrogen is number one on the periodic table, but it\u2019s still a straggler in the renewable energy race. Like many other renewable technologies, hydrogen has dominated headlines for years now, but inefficiencies in the production and storage of green hydrogen hold it back. There\u2019s a lot of pieces to the hydrogen puzzle and one of those pieces, a hydrogen electrolyzer, has had some recent breakthroughs that may help with producing green hydrogen. Is green hydrogen within reach?
