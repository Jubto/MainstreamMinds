Learn more about Search here: https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/Special thanks to J.M.E.H van Bronswijk, author of 'House Dust Biology'. We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scalesThis is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scalesIt depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, syntheticsThat's true .. including bread crumbs ..... \ud83d\ude42- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed...... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.Information on dust particle size \u00a9ISO.

A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for transactional reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.

Masks do double-duty, and the fraction of interactions with masks is much higher than the fraction of people wearing masks, so partially adopted, partially effective masks are able to reduce the basic reproduction number surprisingly well.REFERENCES:Aatish\u2019s detailed writeup on github: https://github.com/aatishb/maskmath/blob/master/model/mathmodel.ipynbAmid the Coronavirus Crisis, a Regimen for Re-entry: https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/amid-the-coronavirus-crisis-a-regimen-for-reentryFace Masks Against COVID-19: An Evidence Review https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v3Mask FAQ Test Results: https://www.maskfaq.com/test-resultsThe Effect of Mask Use on the Spread of Influenza During a Pandemic: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01428.xCalibrated Intervention and Containment of the COVID-19 Pandemic: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.07353.pdfCloth Mask Breathability and Filtration Efficiency Technical Report: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef/t/5f2c4463a5c9f75a38d2b26f/1596736614213/N95DECON_cloth_mask_breathability_filtrationtechnical_report_v1_200804.pdfWhat kind of mask should I be wearing to protect against COVID-19? http://built-envi.com/what-kind-of-mask-should-i-be-wearing-to-protect-against-covid-19/Masks for all?

Let stand until frothy, about 10 minutes- Pour in olive oil, salt and gradually add the flour. Mix on low speed until combined scraping down the sides as needed. - Increase speed to medium-high. Knead in a mixer until dough is smooth and pliable. The dough should be tacky, but If very wet sticky, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time. - Form dough into a smooth ball. Grease a bowl with olive oil and place dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until ball doubles in size, about 1 hour. - Place dough in the refrigerator to ferment for 24 hours. - Remove dough from refrigerator and place on a sheet pan greased with olive oil. Using your fingertips gently stretch dough over the surface of the pan.  The dough does not need to reach rim to rim in this step.

I think technology is cool. With all of the information we have we can learn to create whatever we want. I love watching youtube videos of new inventions and technology but I can't really participate in that world, only observe. I found out when I was young that I am much more creative than anything. I love being creative and pursuing art so I am happy, but still can't help but to be dazzled by the science world. I love thinking of invention ideas though. I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.Stay safe \u2764\ufe0f see you next video.\ud83d\udc55 merch:https://crowdmade.com/collections/icecreamsandwich\ud83d\udcf1 twitter:https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy\ud83d\udcf7 instagram:https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.

Unlike conventional airplanes, tail sitting planes rested on their tails and used engine power alone to lift off the ground before transitioning to vertical flight, and returning to land vertically once again on their tail. The configuration, although technically challenging to develop, would allow aircraft to operate without runways, fundamentally changing how and where air forces could use their aircraft. In the early 1950s French aerospace firm SNECMA (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale d'\u00e9tudes et de construction de moteurs d'aviation) began developing wingless test rigs to prove the viability of the tail sitting concept. At the time, American firms were also developing tail sitting prototypes of their own, But SNECMA would take it a step further by developing a tail sitting aircraft with a highly unconventional annular (cylindrical) wing. The cylindrical wing promised greater efficiency over a conventional wing by eliminating wing-tip vortices. It would also be more compact, further reducing the space needed for vertical take-off and landings. French designers also theorised that a cylindrical wing could eventually be engineered to function as a ramjet engine, propelling the aircraft to supersonic speeds.The C.450 Coleoptere was constructed in 1958, with tethered flight testing beginning in early 1959. By May, the unconventional plane had achieved its first successful unassisted hover, even reaching altitudes of 800 meters. Despite early successes during flight tests, flaws soon emerged in the aircraft\u2019s design. The Coleoptere proved extremely difficult to pilot. An innovative pilot seat could swivel 90 degrees, but pilots still struggled to judge the aircraft\u2019s distance from the ground while landing. Without a conventional wing to provide resistance, the Coleoptere also had a tendency to slowly spin on its axis. On July 25, 1959, the Coleoptere performed it\u2019s 9th test flight. This time, the pilot was to transition the aircraft from vertical to horizontal flight, a challenging procedure that would mark a huge milestone for the program. The Coleoptere lifted off successfully, but during its transition, it suddenly became too inclined and slow-moving to maintain altitude. The aircraft started tumbling back to earth as the pilot struggled to regain control, barely managing to eject at the very last minute. The Coleoptere was destroyed.A second prototype of the Coleoptere would never be built. By the 1960\u2019s it was clear that the tail sitting configuration was a dead-end. It was simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload and range, and far too difficult to pilot. It was clear that vectoring thrust, allowing the aircraft to remain horizontal, was a more practical and safer solution.

Constance's lovely channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ClFJYwA3lDagY4igPKddg Labor ethics disclaimer from the brand which the corset was purchased: https://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/people/factory-workers/Despite this disclaimer, however, I was unable to find satisfactory evidence to prove that the brand have established contractual requirements with their manufacturers to ensure that the factories commissioned to manufacture products are paying their employees at living wages. Furthermore, I was disappointed to find that this brand is one of the many guilty of cancelling partly- or fully-completed orders this year without paying manufacturers for labor performed. For this reason, I do not endorse this brand and I do consider this purchase to be in violation of my anti-fast fashion endeavors. Though I won\u2019t be returning the item, as that doesn\u2019t do anything productive, I will upcycle it into something I can use\u2014and intend to give the purchase of this garment a net-positive outcome by donating the ad revenue from this video to the Clean Clothes Campaign (https://cleanclothes.org/about), an organisation which is dedicated to improving garment worker rights and conditions worldwide. https://goodonyou.eco/adidas-ethical/2019 report on brands and ethical labor policies/future plans: https://labourbehindthelabel.org/report-tailored-wages-uk-2019/https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/company-profile/adidas-agSOURCES & FOOTNOTES:Due to character limitations, the full page of footnotes can be found here: https://bernadettebanner.co.uk/sports-corsetsGartland, Elizabeth.

When the Girls Came Out to Play: The Birth of American Sportswear. Massachusetts, University of Massachusetts Press, August 2, 2006.*I actually disagree with this; I mean, yes, it *could* probably be worn over another corset, but the advertisement declares that this corselet 'supersedes the corset' and highlights its intention to be worn only on the upper part of the body, allowing for perfect freedom of movement in the lower. I think they've drawn this conclusion because of the strange little buttoned tabs coming out the bottom of it, but the advertisement shows the woman using these tabs to button the waist of her skirt in place. Since the Khiva corselet is very short in length, it wouldn't provide that secure anchor point at the waist that normal, bust-to-hip corsets do.

It is a wonderful robot, made out of steel and wire \u2014 but will future robots look like Perseverance? There is an emerging field of  research on soft robots, where the machines are flexible. These soft robots have many advantages over traditional robots \u2014 they're safer, lighter, more flexible and can change their shape and size.NASA is investigating the use of soft robots for space missions. For future visits to Enceladus or Europa, a lander could cut a hole in the ice and then insert a compliant robot through the hole. This robot could then grow and change shape on the other side.References:N. S. Usevitch, Z. M. Hammond, M. Schwager, A. M. Okamura, E. W. Hawkes, S. Follmer, An untethered isoperimetric soft robot.

But Indonesia's biggest city also has a unique problem: Because of restricted water access in the city, the majority of its residents have to extract groundwater to survive. And it's causing the city to sink. Today, Jakarta is the world\u2019s fastest-sinking city.The problem gets worse every year, but the root of it precedes modern Indonesia by centuries. In the 1600s, when the Dutch landed in Indonesia and built present-day Jakarta, they divided up the city to segregate the population. Eventually, that segregation led to an unequal water piping system that excluded most Indigenous Jakartans, forcing them to find other ways to get water.To understand how it all ties together, and what\u2019s in store for Jakarta\u2019s future, watch the video above.

Then, in the 1990s, those laws were dismantled. But many of the barriers they created continue to divide South Africans by skin color - which in turn determines their quality of life, access to jobs, and wealth. Racial division was built into the fabric of cities throughout South Africa, and it still hasn't been uprooted.That's partly because, while apartheid was the culmination of South Africa's racial divisions, it wasn't the beginning of them. That story starts closer to the 1800s, when the British built a network of railroads that transformed the region's economy into one that excluded most Black people -- and then made that exclusion the law.Sources and further reading:If you want to learn more about the railroads and how they impacted Cape Colony\u2019s economy, check out this paper by Johan Fourie and Alonso Herranz Loncan:https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/22/1/73/3930943?redirectedFrom=fulltextTo understand segregation in South Africa\u2019s major urban centers, take a look at this paper about segregation and inequality: https://www.seri-sa.org/images/SERI_Edged_out_report_Final.pdfFor more information on post-Apartheid cities, you can read this paper by Edgar Pieterse (who we feature in the video):https://www.africancentreforcities.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/post-apartheid_geographies_pieterse_15dec09.pdf To explore the history and legacy of District Six, visit the District Six Museum website:https://www.districtsix.co.za/Thanks for watching and let us know what you think in the comments!Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

A nobody. When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake, is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca, seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary --and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.Check out Ted Nivisons video! https://youtu.be/5WrtXDLsCcEThanks to:@Allen Pan - Sufficiently Advanced Morgan RyanJohn WillnerKeanu Training: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWvvRaoWkocPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/williamosman\rTwitter: https://twitter.com/CrabsAndScienceInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/crabsandscience/"}, {"video_id": "qevIIQHrJZg", "title": "This Unstoppable Robot Could Save Your Life", "publishedAt": "2021-04-16T14:11:43Z", "channelId": "UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA", "channelTitle": "Veritasium", "categoryId": 27, "trending_date": "2021-04-17T00:00:00Z", "tags": "veritasium|science|physics|vine robot|vine|robot", "view_count": 1487796, "likes": 75049, "dislikes": 737, "comment_count": 4868, "thumbnail_link": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qevIIQHrJZg/default.jpg", "comments_disabled": false, "ratings_disabled": false, "description": "This robot has applications to archaeology, space exploration, and search and rescue \u2014 with a simple elegant design inspired by a plant.

As expected, the helicopter flew out of its field of vision while completing a flight plan that took it 164 feet (50 meters) downrange of the landing spot. Keep watching, the helicopter will return to stick the landing. Top speed for today's flight was about 2 meters per second, or about 4.5 miles-per-hour.The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was built by JPL, which also manages this technology demonstration project for NASA Headquarters. It is supported by NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, and Space Technology Mission Directorate. NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center provided significant flight performance analysis and technical assistance during Ingenuity\u2019s development.A key objective for Perseverance\u2019s mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet\u2019s geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust). Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA\u2019s Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover.For more about Perseverance:-mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/-nasa.gov/perseveranceCredit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS"}, {"video_id": "ZXs0a7BoWxs", "title": "Coke & Mentos Bottle INSIDE Balloon!! *Experiment!* - #Shorts", "publishedAt": "2021-04-14T00:19:26Z", "channelId": "UCAatjI5Yc8o7WZcHDbNw7eA", "channelTitle": "Cam Casey", "categoryId": 22, "trending_date": "2021-04-26T00:00:00Z", "tags": "balloon|soda|challenge|comedy|viral|snap|snapchat|tiktok|shorts|science|experiment|slomo|slo motion", "view_count": 2329083, "likes": 44695, "dislikes": 8311, "comment_count": 347, "thumbnail_link": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZXs0a7BoWxs/default.jpg", "comments_disabled": false, "ratings_disabled": false, "description": "Hey guys this is my 49th #Shorts video on here!

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines. Check out http://www.vox.com.For the past several years scientists have been trying to account for the 8 million metric tonnes of plastic that we dump into the ocean each year. The assumption was that a large portion of it was floating out in one of the large garbage patches, where swirling debris accumulates thanks to ocean gyres. But recent measurements of the amount of trash in the patches fell far short of what\u2019s thought to be out there. Scientists are getting closer to an answer, which could help clean-up efforts and prevent further damage to marine life and ocean ecosystems. For more reading, check out this New Yorker article on the missing plastic problem, which inspired this video: https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/where-does-all-the-plastic-goLaurent Lebreton\u2019s research that estimates the amount of debris in the garbage patches is here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-wFor more about Ocean Conservancy\u2019s work, and their annual international beach cleanup events: https://oceanconservancy.org/For more reading about Erik Van Sebille\u2019s work: http://erik.vansebille.com/For more reading about Melanie Bergmann\u2019s work: https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226655/microplastics-laundry-wastewater-plastic-pollution-arctic-oceanWatch our full video catalog: http://goo.gl/IZONyEFollow Vox on Facebook: http://goo.gl/U2g06oOr Twitter: http://goo.gl/XFrZ5H"}, {"video_id": "flmkQZvN_g8", "title": "WEED EATER vs WEED EATER in SLOW MOTION - Smarter Every Day 255", "publishedAt": "2021-04-30T01:02:05Z", "channelId": "UC6107grRI4m0o2-emgoDnAA", "channelTitle": "SmarterEveryDay", "categoryId": 28, "trending_date": "2021-04-30T00:00:00Z", "tags": "smarter|every|day|science|physics|destin|sandlin|education|math|smarter every day|experiment|slow|motion|slow motion|education|math|science|science education|what is science|physics of|projects|experiments|science projects|weedeater|weed whacker|string trimmer|strimmer|whipper snipper|lawn care|lawn mower|yard tools|mower|how to weedeat|vs|weedeater ward|phantom slowmo|destin sandlin", "view_count": 370408, "likes": 34947, "dislikes": 508, "comment_count": 4594, "thumbnail_link": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/flmkQZvN_g8/default.jpg", "comments_disabled": false, "ratings_disabled": false, "description": "Weed Eater Wars: 8 Types of Weedeater Line square off in a single elimination battle.Get 1st Audiobook + full access to the Plus Catalog for free when you try Audible for 30 days https://www.audible.com/smarter or TXT smarter to 500500 \u21ca  Click below for more links!  \u21caSometimes you just want to goof around in the garage with friends.... and you happen to end up learning something interesting!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VIEW ALL VIDEOS:View the Weedeater vs Weedeater Main Video Here: https://youtu.be/flmkQZvN_g8View EXTENDED CUT Here: https://youtu.be/61kQ_HNA_GYView FULL Slow Motion Videos From Other Battles:Battle 1 Star vs Crossfire: https://youtu.be/ofVmhIFaItgBattle 2 Triangle vs Sharp Square: https://youtu.be/WkKvIlnaZ7IBattle 3 Razor Core vs Blue Line: https://youtu.be/exsh00F4ocwBattle 4 Sharp Sharp Square Vs Grey Blobby Thing: https://youtu.be/6Ir4fEsZ5IMBattle 5 Razor Core vs Echo Crossfire: https://youtu.be/9nqTK30FL0cBattle 6 Sharp Square vs Grey Round: https://youtu.be/wUgQlcK4_FMBattle 7 Razor Core vs Sharp Square: https://youtu.be/Q8lsC4DfNcYBattle 8 Redo Razor Core vs Grey Blobby Thing: https://youtu.be/XjRpC2HfRIgALL BATTLES in Slow Motion: https://youtu.be/1UmDYUf872o~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Jeremy Fielding's Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_SLthyNX_ivd-dmsFgmJVgTweet Ideas to me at:http://twitter.com/smartereverydaySmarter Every Day on Facebookhttps://www.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDaySmarter Every Day on Patreonhttp://www.patreon.com/smartereverydaySmarter Every Day On Instagramhttp://www.instagram.com/smartereverydaySmarter Every Day SubReddithttp://www.reddit.com/r/smartereverydayAmbiance, audio and musicy things by: Gordon McGladdery https://www.ashellinthepit.com/http://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/If you feel like this video was worth your time and added value to your life, please SHARE THE VIDEO!If you REALLY liked it, I'd love it if you'd consider becoming a Patron of Smarter Every Day on Patreon!http://www.patreon.com/smartereverydayWarm Regards,Destin"}, {"video_id": "flmkQZvN_g8", "title": "What happens when 2 Weedeaters Hit Each Other?

With mere weeks before impact and the world on the brink of annihilation, NASA executive and former astronaut Jo Fowler (Academy Award\u00ae winner Halle Berry) is convinced she has the key to saving us all \u2013 but only one astronaut from her past, Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson, \u201cMidway\u201d) and a conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman (John Bradley, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) believes her. These unlikely heroes will mount an impossible last-ditch mission into space, leaving behind everyone they love, only to find out that our Moon is not what we think it is.Directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Roland Emmerich & Harald Kloser & Spenser Cohen, the film also stars Michael Pe\u00f1a, Charlie Plummer, Kelly Yu, Eme Ikwuakor, Carolina Bartczak, and Donald Sutherland."}, {"video_id": "XKtynjNTfa4", "title": "The Creature That Stumped Darwin", "publishedAt": "2021-09-01T22:18:36Z", "channelId": "UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA", "channelTitle": "PBS Eons", "categoryId": 28, "trending_date": "2021-09-03T00:00:00Z", "tags": "isolation|south america|mammals|pleistocene|toxodon|darwin|uruguay|evolution|extinction|macrauchenia|meridiungulata|ungulate|perissodactyla|paleontology|natural history", "view_count": 260278, "likes": 18226, "dislikes": 137, "comment_count": 589, "thumbnail_link": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XKtynjNTfa4/default.jpg", "comments_disabled": false, "ratings_disabled": false, "description": "Check out Mega Wow: https://youtu.be/meU4f31gqYI And go get our pins!! https://store.dftba.com/collections/eonsToxodon was one of the last members of a lineage that vanished 11,000 years ago after thriving in isolation for millions of years.

Yes, that's right, we are, for now, moving to do themed Seasons instead of just Updates. Season 01 includes four new primary weapons, a new challenging boss-fight mission, and we're introducing a major new addition to the game: the Performance Pass - our take on a 100% FREE Battle Pass.For us here at Ghost Ship, this feels like a significant moment, almost akin to how we felt launching into 1.0 last year. To celebrate this and to showcase all the cool new features and concepts, we've put together this 6 minutes long trailer narrated by Mission Control himself.SEASON 01 AND THE PERFORMANCE PASSThe addition of the Performance Pass is to offer a regular cadence of cosmetics that are accessible to both new and long-standing players, as well as expand on the reasons to keep on mining - we gotta meet those quotas, Miners!The Performance Pass contains 100 levels of free unlocks for you to pursue - from tokens called Scrips that allow you to pick and choose from a Cosmetic Tree, to satchels of Credits and crafting materials, to brand-new Victory Moves, and even a FULL set of new Weapon Frameworks for every gun in the game - including the four new ones.RIVAL TECH DLCTo go along with Season 01, there is of course also a tasty new cosmetic DLC Pack. The RIVAL TECH PACK will let you deck out your guns even further in style - this time themed to go with the all-new enemy faction introduced with the Update.

A start-up may have a solid technology that could speed up the energy transition. Spoiler: It\u2019s so good it was banned!Watch Solar Panels Plus Farming?

Here is a weird video we made where I melted every soap from Lush together into a few different batches of franken-soap!! This type of franken-experiment has worked well in the past across a wide array of products like lipsticks, foundations, candles, and bath bombs (also from Lush!) - and as some of you may know, over the years I have developed a bit of a soap fixation, having recreated a couple different soap art tutorials, as well as several bizarre soap art hacks from the internet. So I was excited to combine these two interests together by mixing every single soap from a single store to see what kind of soap bar we could whip up. What did you think of our final product??Thanks to Anne-Marie at Bramble Berry and Katie at Royalty Soaps!

Subscribe and turn on notifications \ud83d\udd14 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjOIn the \u201980s, scientists discovered there was a hole in the ozone over the South Pole. A significant layer of gas that deflects much of the sun\u2019s radiation was disappearing much faster than anyone expected. Projections suggested it would collapse by 2050, increasing skin cancer rates, harming crops, and destroying the marine food chain. The situation was dire. But today, we are on the path to recovery.Dr. Susan Solomon, among other scientists, contributed key findings to understand what was depleting the ozone layer and how to address it. In this video she takes us back to her expedition to Antarctica, breaks down how we managed to fix this huge problem, and looks at our next big environmental challenge \u2014 climate change \u2014 with the unbridled optimism that drove her to fix the ozone hole.Further reading: To learn about the scientific discoveries by Mario J.

The third solo joint for Tom Holland's Peter Parker finds Spidey looking to conceal his outed secret identity by any means necessary, and when Doctor Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) efforts to do so go terribly awry, Peter faces off against classic villains from far-flung universes. To celebrate the release of the new film, stars Holland, Zendaya (MJ), and Jacob Batalon (Ned Leeds) sit down to talk about the journey of their characters, from the first time Holland learned he would be Marvel's new Spider-Man to his first appearance in 'Captain America: Civil War' and his first time trying on the suit (we won't spoil what he compared it to; it's... private). Zendaya and Batalon also discuss what it's like to be a part of the franchise, traveling the world with friends and running from explosions, and what some of their favorite moments throughout the series have been.Watch More:\u25ba New on RT: http://bit.ly/2D4vReA\u25ba Exclusive Interviews: http://bit.ly/2APqfQl\u25ba Rotten Tomatoes Originals: http://bit.ly/2EzyjGO\u25ba Celebrity Games: http://bit.ly/2FNDBTsMusic:Courtesy of Extreme MusicJoin the Conversation:\u25ba Subscribe to ROTTEN TOMATOES: http://bit.ly/2EwugLH\u25ba Subscribe to the ROTTEN TOMATOES NEWSLETTER: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/newsletter?cmp=RTYT_YouTube_Desc\u25ba Follow us on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/2mpschF\u25ba Like us on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/2COySMI\u25ba Follow us on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/2FlxGC6From original shows and celebrity interviews to Tomatometer scores, ROTTEN TOMATOES is your insider\u2019s guide to must-see movies and TV.#SpiderMan #MCU #RottenTomatoes"}, {"video_id": "EJjJank-mo0", "title": "All Access - Paul vs. Woodley 2 - Part 1", "publishedAt": "2021-12-13T21:52:15Z", "channelId": "UCcgVECVN4OKV6DH1jLkqmcA", "channelTitle": "Jake Paul", "categoryId": 22, "trending_date": "2021-12-15T00:00:00Z", "tags": "showtime|shosports|sports|floyd mayweather|money mayweather|logan paul|jake paul|paul brothers|showtime boxing|boxing|shosports|showtime boxing ppv|showtime ppv|press conference|tyron woodley|paul woodley|jake paul tyron woodley|boxer|ufc|ppv|biggest boxing fights|biggest boxing fights in history|crazy kos|tommy fury|montana love|serrano|amanda serrano|deron williams|frank gore|paul woodley 2|paul woodley highlights|paul woodley rematch", "view_count": 327971, "likes": 17790, "dislikes": 0, "comment_count": 1326, "thumbnail_link": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EJjJank-mo0/default.jpg", "comments_disabled": false, "ratings_disabled": false, "description": "I'm coming to TAMPA on Dec. 18t!.

Then why does Japan approve so many food additives in the first place?https://youtu.be/LLfDB18MibEHorrifying fact: some studies point out that Japan approves the largest number of food additives in the world. While most countries only have about a few dozens of allowable food additives, Japan is said to have more than 1,500 kinds. Of course not all of them are harmful, but some of them are banned in many foreign countries.For example, the food coloring agent called red #2 (included in jelly and soft drinks) is believed to increase the risk of cancer and hives. Trans-fatty acids (included in bread and snacks) is said to increase the risk of myocardial infarction, strokes, and dementia.The food additives have all been officially approved by the government as \u201cunharmful against humans after undergoing rigorous investigation, however many scientists in Japan question the following:1. The experiments have only been done on animals2. They have only tested each food additive one at a time and haven't checked what would happen upon intaking multiple kinds on long terms3. Many of these food additives are confirmed by WHO as cancer-causing/brain damagingUnfortunately, you may be trading the rest of your healthy life for Japan's colorful and delicious-looking foods.*The content is based on personal studies and experienceThere is no intention of denying other theories and cultural aspects\u25bcWho is Shogo?

For example, suppose in a word like woody the first 'o' is correct, hence green, then in the real Wordle that second 'o' would be grey, whereas the way I wrote things the rule as simply any letter which is in the word somewhere, but not in the right position, will be yellow.To be honest, even after realizing this differed from the proper rule, I stuck with it because it made the computation of the full matrix of word-combination patterns more elegant (and faster), and the normal rule has always slightly bothered me. Of course, it doesn't make any difference for the actual lesson here on entropy, which is the primary goal, and at least as I've gone back tried rerunning some of the models with the correct convention, it doesn't really change the final results.Contents:0:00 - What is Wordle?2:43 - Initial ideas8:04 - Information theory basics18:15 - Incorporating word frequencies27:49 - Final performanceOriginal wordle site:https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/Music by Vincent Rubinetti.https://www.vincentrubinetti.com/Shannon and von Neumann artwork by Kurt Bruns.Code for this video:https://github.com/3b1b/videos/blob/master/_2022/wordle.pyThese animations are largely made using a custom python library, manim.

In the world of quantum mechanics, it\u2019s no big deal for particles to be in multiple different states at the same time, or to teleport between locations, or to influence each other faster than light. But somehow, none of this strangeness makes its way to the familiar scale of human beings - even though our world is made entirely of quantum-weird building blocks. The explanations of this transition range from the mystical influence of the conscious mind to the grandiose proposition of multiple realities.

Russian President Vladimir Putin called it a \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d but the scale of the attack shows this is a full-scale war that has already caused more than 100 casualties and forced more than half a million Ukrainians to flee their homes.Ukraine and Russia\u2019s conflict goes back to 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces took over parts of southeastern Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region. But to understand the full context behind the invasion, it\u2019s important to go even farther back, to the time when Europe\u2019s current-day divisions began, and see how that shaped Europe\u2019s power balance today. To understand the current conflict\u2019s history in less than 10 minutes, watch the video above.

Soak the gelatin in cold water for 5 minutes. 2. Bring the water and sugar to a simmer in a large saucepan then remove it from the heat. Squeeze out any excess water in the gelatin, then add it to the water and stir until dissolved. Stir in the Chartreuse. 3. Pour the liquid into a well greased mold, then refrigerate for 1-3 hours, or until the jelly is beginning to thicken. 4. To remove the skin from the peaches, score and X at the bottom of the peaches, then plunge into boiling water for 45 seconds, then immediately into ice cold water for 10 seconds. If the peaches are ripe, the skin should easily slide off. Remove the pit and slice.5. Heat the simple syrup to simmering, then add the peach slices. Coat and turn off the heat and let them cool in the syrup. 6. Carefully insert the peaches into the jelly in whatever pattern you like. Then return to the refrigerator until fully set. 8 - 24 hours depending on the depth of the mold. 7. Once set, run a knife around the edge of the jelly, then dip the mold into hot (not boiling) water for 5 seconds. Remove it and place a well greased plate over the top of the mold then flip it over. The jelly should fall out with little more than a tap. 8. Top with Italian meringue or whipped cream, and serve.  **Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Tasting History will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

They spent nearly a decade recording collisions in the Tevatron collider and another decade analysing the data. This culminated in the April 7 announcement that this obscure particle\u2019s mass seems to be heavier than expected. So why do we care? Because understanding why this particle even has mass was one of the most important breakthroughs in our understanding of the subatomic world. And because measuring its precise mass either doubles down on our current understanding or reveals a path to an even deeper knowledge. The FermiLab discrepancy is a tantalizing hint of the latter.Need Catch Up On Your Fundamental Forces?https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNAnurqRx9JlDGukZCsYcLhFCheck out the Space Time Merch Storehttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shopSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!https://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetimeHosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Fernando Franco F\u00e9lix, Graeme Gossel, & Matt O'Dowd Post Production by Leonardo Scholzer, Yago Ballarini, Pedro Osinski, Adriano Leal & Stephanie FariaGFX Visualizations: Fernando Franco F\u00e9lixDirected by Andrew KornhaberAssociate Producer: Bahar GholipourExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberExecutives in Charge (PBS): Adam Dylewski, Maribel Lopez Director of Programming (PBS): Gabrielle Ewing Spacetime is produced by Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.This program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.\u00a9 2022 PBS.

Watch our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1sOriginally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super \u201cnormal.\u201d I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. We discovered the world of \u201ctravel hacking\u201d & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a \u201cone year\u201d trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to \u201cnormal life.\u201d We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf0e  #travel #travelvlog #alcatraz 0:00 Our biggest fear0:50 Why are we doing this?!3:41 Seeing Alcatraz for the first time4:19 INSIDE Alcatraz (prison tour)5:50 What we are wearing to swim7:29 BEST VPN8:35 MORNING OF THE SWIM12:42 JUMPING IN the San Francisco Bay19:19 Our final thoughts on the swim"}, {"video_id": "Y3uOQZolYQM", "title": "The Dark History of 2b2t's Bedrock Sphere", "publishedAt": "2022-05-28T13:59:09Z", "channelId": "UCHZ986wm_sJT6wntdDTIIcw", "channelTitle": "FitMC", "categoryId": 20, "trending_date": "2022-05-29T00:00:00Z", "tags": "minecraft|history|update|mobs|creeper|raid|nether|sea|monster|dragon|red|2b2t|anarchy|server|fitmc|fit|oldest|builds|tour|battle|spawn|grief|hack|client|incursion|tutorial|herobrine|hacked|exploit|glitch|mojang|flying|redstone|smp|live|campfire|blast|furnace|memes|house|respawn|pvp|popbob|animation|speedrun|duplication|bed|minecon|mc|unsolved|mystery|end|caves|cliffs|warden|beast|mrbeast|fotmc|tb2t|schlatt|jschlatt|schlat|1.19|wild|2n2t|only nerds read tags lmaooooo", "view_count": 365374, "likes": 26226, "dislikes": 0, "comment_count": 1015, "thumbnail_link": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y3uOQZolYQM/default.jpg", "comments_disabled": false, "ratings_disabled": false, "description": "Use POGFITMCMAY16 for up to 16 FREE MEALS + 3 surprise gifts across 6 HelloFresh Boxes, plus free shipping at https://strms.net/hellofresh_fitmc #ad3\ufe0f\u20e3 people have already claimed this exclusive offer!Today on the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft, we discuss The Dark History of 2b2t's Bedrock SphereMy Twitter: FitMCMy Instagram: fitmcsippycupAdditional Images:skulleriTristanMusic:homieonice (Instagram)FFXFFXVIf you enjoyed this video about The Dark History of 2b2t's Bedrock Sphere, I would appreciate if you would consider hitting that like and subscribe button!2b2t is one of the craziest places in Minecraft, and is updating to 1.18/1.19 soon!"}, {"video_id": "oQUyovbOIJo", "title": "Power Book III: Raising Kanan | Season 2 Official Teaser | STARZ", "publishedAt": "2022-05-27T13:00:24Z", "channelId": "UCXVxMuWK6l_pCyxEk07EIRw", "channelTitle": "STARZ", "categoryId": 24, "trending_date": "2022-05-29T00:00:00Z", "tags": "power book iii|raising kanan|power kanan|power never ends|legacy|sneak peek|preview|starz|television|tv|new power|aftermath|spinoff|power spinoff|finale|new|new episodes|power|power on starz|power iii on starz|power book iii: kanan clip|power book iii: raising kanan official clip|power book kanan|trailer|kanan power book trailer|raising kanan sneak peek|season preview|ep 6|episode 6|sneak preview", "view_count": 125059, "likes": 3263, "dislikes": 0, "comment_count": 354, "thumbnail_link": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oQUyovbOIJo/default.jpg", "comments_disabled": false, "ratings_disabled": false, "description": "It's a family business.

Moreover, many of the supposed advantages of shipping containers turn out to be more complicated in reality.Vox\u2019s Phil Edwards spent a night in a shipping container home to see how the experience of staying in a shipping container compares with the reality of building one.Further Reading:Mark Hogan\u2019s 2015 opinion piece about shipping containers is a great introduction to the topic: https://www.archdaily.com/773491/opinion-whats-wrong-with-shipping-container-housing-everythingBelinda Carr\u2019s debunking of shipping containers gets into more building science detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yEDz6bCfUShe\u2019s also an even-handed critic and made a video about five shipping container successes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkG3gmPUPQgYou can check out Michael\u2019s Airbnbs here: https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/329149776Make sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletterVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
